Question,Answer
"What is the purpose of this tool?","This tool helps predict possible diseases based on symptoms provided by the user using AI and machine learning."
"How does the tool work?","The tool analyzes symptoms provided by the user and uses pre-trained machine learning models to predict the most likely disease category and subcategory."
"What kind of symptoms can I input?","You can input symptoms like fever, cough, headache, fatigue, sore throat, and more."
"What diseases can this tool predict?","The tool predicts diseases like flu, cold, respiratory infections, gastrointestinal disorders, and more, depending on the symptoms."
"Can I input multiple symptoms?","Yes, you can input multiple symptoms at once to get a more accurate prediction."
"Is my data secure?","Yes, your data is secure and processed in real time. We do not store or share your information with third parties."
"What should I do if my symptoms don’t match any prediction?","If no match is found, the tool may not cover that specific disease. Please consult a healthcare professional for further advice."
"Can this tool replace a doctor’s consultation?","No, this tool is for informational purposes only and cannot replace professional medical advice."
"How accurate are the predictions?","The predictions are based on machine learning models trained on healthcare data and are highly reliable. However, they are not 100% accurate."
"What should I do if I suspect the prediction is wrong?","Double-check your symptoms and input them again. If the result still seems incorrect, consult a healthcare professional for an expert opinion."
"What happens if I enter symptoms that are not recognized?","The tool will only predict diseases based on known symptom patterns. Unrecognized symptoms will result in no prediction or an inaccurate result."
"Who developed this tool?","The tool was developed by an AI team from Vishwakarma University to make healthcare accessible through technology."
"What is machine learning, and how does it relate to this tool?","Machine learning is a method where computers learn from data. This tool uses machine learning to identify patterns in symptoms and predict diseases."
"Is this tool free to use?","Yes, this tool is free for educational and informational purposes."
"Can this tool detect rare diseases?","The tool primarily focuses on common diseases. Rare disease detection depends on the dataset used to train the models."
"How are the diseases categorized?","Diseases are categorized into broad groups like respiratory, gastrointestinal, and infections, based on symptom patterns."
"Can I add symptoms not listed in the tool?","Currently, the tool supports a predefined set of symptoms. Future updates may allow adding custom symptoms."
"How is AI used in this project?","AI models analyze user-provided symptoms and match them with disease patterns to provide predictions."
"How long does it take to get a prediction?","The prediction is provided instantly after you input your symptoms."
"What if I need help using the tool?","You can visit the FAQ page or contact our support team via the Contact Us page for assistance."
